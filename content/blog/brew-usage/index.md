If you install any formula, brew will search by the order:

1. custom repo
2. homebrew/core

## if you occurs

#### Error: formula: /usr/local/Homebrew/.../xxx.rb:6 syntax error, unexpected <<

Fetch and reset Homebrew and all tap repositories to their latest origin/master.

```bash
$ brew update-reset

## also

As we can see on the info page, packages are installed to `/usr/local/Cellar/` folder.

The normal flow is: `update` -> `upgrade` -> `cleanup`.
